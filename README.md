You will have a green circle, control it with mouse (It slowly follows it). A red circle will be chasing you. If it catches you, game over. There will also be smallyellow circles that you can eat. If you eat one, the red circle will slow down for 2 seconds, and you become faster for 1 second. There will also be blue even smaller circles that are rarer and do the same as yellow ones, except they make it so the red circle can't move for 2 seconds.
